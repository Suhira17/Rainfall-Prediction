# Rainfall-Prediction

## Abstract

- Our goal is to train a machine learning model using the given dataset that can accurately predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not. To accomplish this, we will follow a step-by-step procedure.

## steps

- We will start by importing the necessary modules such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. Then, we will load the dataset from the attached CSV file using the pandas library.

- Next, we need to preprocess our dataset. This involves handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical form, and removing any unnecessary columns and scaling the features using the min-max scaler.

- Once the preprocessing is done, we will need to split the dataset into independent variables (X) and dependent variables (y), where the target variable is "RainTomorrow". which is whether it will rain tomorrow or not.

- To ensure that all our features are on a similar scale, we will use the min-max scaler to scale the features. This step is important as it helps prevent any bias that may occur due to differences in the magnitude of the variables.

- After scaling the features, we will split our dataset into a training set and a testing set using the train-test split function. The training set will be used to train our machine learning model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

- To further improve our model's performance,we can apply dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This helps in reducing the number of features by combining them into a smaller set of variables without losing too much information.

- Once the dataset is preprocessed and split, we will proceed to apply various classification algorithms to our model.Here we use 11 different classification algorithms and by comparing the performance of these algorithms, we can identify the best one for predicting rainfall.

- Additionally, we will use hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the performance of our model. This involves fine-tuning the parameters of our classification algorithms to achieve the best accuracy.


## Conclusion

- After following the step-by-step procedure which includes importing modules, preprocessing data, scaling features, splitting the data, applying PCA, and utilizing classification algorithms, my findings suggest that RandomForestRegression performs the best. Following closely are GradientBoostingClassifier, BaggingClassifier, and ExtraTreesClassifier. RandomForestRegression excels because it aggregates the outputs from multiple decision trees, selecting the output with the highest count from these trees. This approach leverages the diversity of results obtained from different sets of data samples given to different decision trees, resulting in a robust and effective classification.
